## Steps

These are the steps I followed when working on this app:

1. Setting up project
2. Adding Mongoose 
3. Defining a Mongoose Schema
4. Adding Routes
5. Refactoring

## Running Locally
```bash
git clone git@github.com:veranika-isakova/jobs-api.git
cd jobs-api
yarn install
yarn start
```
Make sure that you have at least v.8 version of Node.js installed on your computer and MongoDB is available.
